You will hear me say this a lot, but the tidyverse is not simply a set of functions or packages built for working with data. Instead, Hadley Wickham built the tidyverse to develop a new way of using the R language that adheres to long-established standards in data engineering. At the foundation of the tidyverse are the rules that govern "tidy data". These rules represent a recommended structure for your data that ensures that your data are robust against errors, easy to modify, and easy to work with. In the video lesson below (runtime: 18:37), you will learn:

* Why tidy data is an important consideration in data management
* Three of the primary rules of normal (a.k.a. "tidy") data from the perspective of data engineering and relational databases
* The tidy data rules, which describe the normal data rules in statistical language
* How to apply functions from ***2.1 Reshaping data frames*** to the data normalization process.

A couple of things to note prior to watching the video:

* I am not crazy about the column or data set names here (camelCase; I made this video several years ago -- prior to the R community recommendation for snake_case).
* You may either code along using the script file `2.3_tidy_data.R` or just watch the video!
