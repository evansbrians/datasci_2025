Welcome to **Module 2: Introduction to the tidyverse**! In this set of lessons, we will explore the primary tidyverse tools for pre-processing and visualizing ecological data. You will learn:

-   What tidy data are;
-   How to "tidy" data;
-   Tools for reshaping data with the core tidyverse packages *dplyr* and *tidyr*;
-   How to visualize data with *ggplot*;
-   More tools to ensure your success in this course!

Before continuing, please be sure that you have completed all of the preliminary course content (Preliminary lessons 1-4) and all of the content from Module 1.

## Module overview

This module is divided into the following sections:

-   **2.1 Introduction to tidy data**: At the core of the tidyverse is the principles of tidy data. In this video lesson (runtime: ~20:00), you will learn what tidy data is and why it matters!
-   **2.2 Reshaping data frames**: There are a lot of applications that require reshaping data frames. In this tutorial, we primarily focus on reshaping data frames during what I call "data pre-processing" -- modifying data as we read it into R. 
-   **2.3 Review of tidy data**: Here, we will review the rules that govern tidy data and practice transitioning from assignments to piped code while we tidy a very messy dataset. *Do not skip this lesson, as you will write the data to your hard drive and use those data for many of the lessons below!*
-   **2.4 Introduction to data visualization with ggplot**: We will be visualizing data a lot throughout this course. To do so, we will use the tidyverse package, ggplot2 (a core package). In this video (runtime: ~32:00) and written lesson we will learn how to use the tidyverse for effective data visualization.
-   **2.5 Course style guide, part 2**: This lesson builds on the set of code formatting rules that I ask you to follow in the course. The provided rules are closely aligned with the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.

## Getting started

Before you begin this week's lessons, please download the attached zip file [module_2_files.zip]{.mono} and:

* Place any R script files ([*.R]{.mono}) in the [data_sci/scripts]{.mono} folder.
    
* Place the following data files in the folder [data/raw]{.mono}:
    * [angola_ungulates.rds]{.mono}
    * [chickadees.csv]{.mono}
    * [district_birds.rds]{.mono}
    * [messy_weather.rds]{.mono}

## About this week's data

This week we will use the following data files in our exercises:

**[angola_ungulates.rds]{.mono}**: These data are formatted as a list of two tibble data frames and represent all observations of ungulates in Angola by the iNaturalist community science project. I downloaded these data using the R package “rinat”. Taxonomic information for the observed species were obtained from the [Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)](https://www.itis.gov/) and downloaded using the R package “taxize”.

**[chickadees.csv]{.mono}**: This file includes measures of Carolina and Black-capped chickadees across several regions of the United States. The data were collected by the Smithsonian Neighborhood Nestwatch Project, a community science project. Measurements taken include the species of bird, mass, wing length, and sex. You can learn more about Neighborhood Nestwatch at [this link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/neighborhood-nestwatch).

**[district_birds.rds]{.mono}**: This is a tidy dataset that contains a subset of records from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center's [Neighborhood Nestwatch](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/neighborhood-nestwatch) (NN) program. NN is a community science project where scientists visit backyards, neighborhoods, and schools to conduct bird banding demonstrations and sample bird populations. The data include tables for sites, visits, point counts, and capture events, and a table that provides natural history information for observed birds. Geographic coordinate values have been jittered to protect the privacy of NN participants.

**[messy_weather.csv]{.mono}**: This is an intentionally messied NOAA weather dataset (messied by Brian). The data were collected from 2010-2020 at five NOAA weather stations located in California, North Carolina, New York, and Wisconsin. The file contains measures of preciptiation, snow, and temperatures during the month of March. These data were messied as a teaching tool -- while it's painful to look at this table, I have interacted with many weather files that were formatted similarly!

## Readings and resources

<button class="accordion">Functions used through the end of this module (I am a button ... click me!)</button>
::: panel
**Important!** Primitive functions as well as functions in the *base* and *utils* packages, are loaded by default when you start an R session. Functions in *tibble* and *tidyverse* are loaded with `library(tidyverse)`. Although the *magrittr* package is not a part of the core tidyverse, the `%>%` function is imported by the *dplyr* (core tidyverse) library.

::: function_table

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

file.path(
  "function_tables",
  "functions_through_module_2.csv"
) %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(
    align = c("c", "c", "l", "l")
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    font_size = 12,
    bootstrap_options = "hover")
```
