You will hear me say this a lot, but the tidyverse is not simply a set of functions or packages built for working with data. Instead, Hadley Wickham built the tidyverse to develop a new way of using the R language that adheres to long-established standards in data engineering. At the foundation of the tidyverse are the rules that govern "tidy data". These rules represent a recommended structure for your data that ensures that your data are robust against errors, easy to modify, and easy to work with. In the video lesson below (runtime: 20:42), you will learn:

* Why tidy data is an important consideration in data management
* Three of the primary rules of normal (a.k.a. "tidy") data from the perspective of data engineering and relational databases
* The tidy data rules, which describe the normal data rules in statistical language
