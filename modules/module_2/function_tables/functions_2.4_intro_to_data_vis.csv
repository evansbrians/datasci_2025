Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,~,The formula operator separates the left- and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) in a formula.
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
.Primitive,$,Infix operator that extracts the values associated with a name (RHS) from a recursive object (LHS)
.Primitive,+,Infix arithmetic operator (addition)
.Primitive,-,Infix arithmetic operator (subtract) or prefix negative symbol operator
.Primitive,/,Infix arithmetic operator (divide)
.Primitive,c,Combine values to form an atomic vector
base,factor,Convert a character vector to a factor
base,library,Attach the package environment for a given package to the current R session
base,list2env,Assign the items in a list to a specified environment
base,rm,Remove a name from a specified environment (default is the global environment)
base,summary,Print summary stats for a data object
base,table,Count the number of unique observations in an atomic vector
base,unit,Set or create a unit object
dplyr,group_by,Group the data in a data frame by a given variable such that one or more subsequent analyses are run separately on each group
dplyr,left_join,"A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains all records found in the target table, regardless of matching key values"
dplyr,n,Calculate the number of observations (rows)
dplyr,select,Subset columns in a data frame by name (without quotes!)
dplyr,slice_max,Sort a data frame by a variable and subset to the rows associated with the highest values of that variable
dplyr,summarize,Calculate one or more summary statistics on a variable or variables in a data frame (often used in conjunction with `group_by()` but may also be used with `.by = ...`)
