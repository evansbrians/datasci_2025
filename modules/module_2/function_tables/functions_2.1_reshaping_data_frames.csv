.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
.Primitive,::,Infix operator that can be used to access a package environment without attaching the whole package environment to your current session
