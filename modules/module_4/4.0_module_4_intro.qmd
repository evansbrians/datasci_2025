Welcome to **Module 4: Focus on subsetting**! This set of lessons dives more deeply into the realm of subsetting data -- the process of reducing the number of items in a list (including columns in a data frame!), rows in a data frame, or values in an atomic vector. In this module, we will review the basics of filtering, you will get a bit more practice with tidying (i.e. normalizing) data, and you will learn how to:

-   Subset data by date;
-   Filter multiple columns in a single step;
-   Subset strings using "RegEx";
-   Filter grouped data;
-   Subset atomic vectors and lists.

Before continuing, please be sure that you have completed all of the preliminary course content (Preliminary lessons 1-4) and all of the content from Modules 1-3.

## Module overview

This module (and *most* of module 5) are a little different in that almost all of the new content is provided in videos. Written tutorial content is meant only to support your understand of the the video content. This module is divided into the following sections:

-   **4.1. Advanced filtering**: In this video lesson (runtime -- 31:16) and compendium tutorial, we will review basic filtering and break new ground on how to filter by date, reduce repetition when filtering multiple variables, introduces the concept of "regular expressions", and filter grouped data.
-   **4.2. Filtering strings**: This video lesson (runtime -- 42:32) and compendium tutorial provides the basics of using regular expressions (literal characters and metacharacters) to filter strings.
-   **4.3. Introduction to subsetting**:  In the final video lesson (runtime -- 25:56) and compendium tutorial we will address how to subset vectors (atomic vectors and lists) by position, name, and logic.
-   **Addendum: Glossary of terms and functions, Modules 1-4**: Herein, I provide a written documentation of all of the terminology and functions we have used thus far. 

## Getting started

Please download the attached zip file [module_4_files.zip]{.mono} and place any R script files ([*.R]{.mono}) in the [data_sci/scripts]{.mono} folder. If there are any script files you already have (e.g., [source_script.R]{.mono} ), please overwrite the previous file.

## About this week's data

This week we will use the following data files in our exercises:

**iris.rds**: This is Edgar Anderson's famous data set that provides the measurements of flowers of three species of iris, *Iris setosa*, *I. versicolor*, and *I. virginica*. See `?iris` for more information (or the original paper at [this link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2394164)!).

**[my_covid_garden.csv]{.mono}**: This is a tabular dataset that describes a pretty unsuccessful raised bed garden at my home in Takoma Park, Maryland.

**[spotted_lanternfly.rd]{.mono}**: This is a tabular dataset of [iNaturalist observation of spotted lanternfly (*Lycorma delicatula*)](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/spotted-lanternfly){target="_blank"}, an invasive pest species whose spread is of commercial and ecological concern. Each row is an observation submitted by a community science participant via a web or smartphone application. The data were downloaded using the R package *rinat*.
