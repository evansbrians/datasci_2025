.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values

.Primitive,c,Combine values to form an atomic vector
.Primitive,is.na,A logical test of whether a value in a vector is [NA]
.Primitive,max,Return the highest value in a numeric vector (integer or double) as a one-value numeric or integer vector (depending on input)
.Primitive,min,Return the lowest value in a numeric vector (integer or double) as a one-value numeric or integer vector (depending on input)
base,%in%,Infix relational operator that tests whether the vector on the left-hand-side (LHS) is within the vector on the right
base,library,Attach the package environment for a given package to the current R session
base,list2env,Assign the items in a list to a specified environment
base,mean,Generate a one-value double numeric vector that describes the mean of a vector
base,summary,Print summary stats for a data object
dplyr,anti_join,A filtering join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records in which the key values *do not* match
dplyr,arrange,Sort the rows of a data frame by the values in a variable or variables
dplyr,bind_cols,Combine two variables or columns of two tibbles to create a new tibble
dplyr,desc,"When used with `arrange()`, this sorts the rows of a data frame by the values of a variable in descending order"
dplyr,distinct,Subset a data frame by removing duplicate rows
dplyr,filter,Subset a data frame by logical condition
dplyr,full_join,"A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains all records in both tables, regardless of matching key values"
dplyr,group_by,Group the data in a data frame by a given variable such that one or more subsequent analyses are run separately on each group
dplyr,inner_join,A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records with matching key values
dplyr,left_join,"A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains all records found in the target table, regardless of matching key values"
dplyr,mutate,Add or modify a column in a data frame
dplyr,n,Calculate the number of observations (rows)
dplyr,rename,Change the name assigned to a column in a data frame
dplyr,select,Subset columns in a data frame by name (without quotes!)
dplyr,semi_join,A filtering join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records with matching key values
dplyr,slice,Subset a data frame by row or rows using the row position(s)
dplyr,slice_head,Subset a data frame to the first row (default) or rows
dplyr,slice_tail,Subset a data frame to the last row (default) or rows
dplyr,slice_min,Sort a data frame by a variable and subset to the rows associated with the lowest values of that variable
dplyr,slice_max,Sort a data frame by a variable and subset to the rows associated with the highest values of that variable
dplyr,summarize,Calculate one or more summary statistics on a variable or variables in a data frame (often used in conjunction with `group_by()` but may also be used with `.by = ...`)
dplyr,ungroup,Remove any grouping on a data frame
magrittr,%>%,The pipe operator passes the output of the LHS argument to the function on the right
readr,read_csv,Read a tabular csv file into R as a tibble data frame
readr,read_rds,Read an RDS file into R
tidyr,pivot_longer,Convert a data frame from wide to long format
tidyr,pivot_wider,Convert a data frame from long to wide format
tidyr,replace_na,Replace an NA value in a vector with a different value
tidyselect,everything,"Used in combination with select, this selects all but the specified columns."
