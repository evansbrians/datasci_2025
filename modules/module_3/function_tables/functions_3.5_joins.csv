Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
.Primitive,==,Infix relational operator (is equal to)
.Primitive,!,Prefix logical operator (not)
.Primitive,/,Infix arithmetic operator (divide)
.Primitive,c,Combine values to form an atomic vector
base,%in%,Infix relational operator that tests whether the vector on the left-hand-side (LHS) is within the vector on the right
base,library,Attach the package environment for a given package to the current R session
base,list2env,Assign the items in a list to a specified environment
base,rm,Remove a name from a specified environment (default is the global environment)
base,summary,Print summary stats for a data object
dplyr,anti_join,A filtering join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records in which the key values *do not* match
dplyr,arrange,Sort the rows of a data frame by the values in a variable or variables
dplyr,filter,Subset a data frame by logical condition
dplyr,full_join,"A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains all records in both tables, regardless of matching key values"
dplyr,group_by,Group the data in a data frame by a given variable such that one or more subsequent analyses are run separately on each group
dplyr,inner_join,A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records with matching key values
dplyr,join_by,Specify the key columns within a join function
dplyr,left_join,"A mutating join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains all records found in the target table, regardless of matching key values"
dplyr,mutate,Add or modify a column in a data frame
dplyr,n,Calculate the number of observations (rows)
dplyr,pull,Extract a column from a data frame as a vector
dplyr,select,Subset columns in a data frame by name (without quotes!)
dplyr,semi_join,A filtering join that joins a source table to a target table and maintains only records with matching key values
dplyr,slice_max,Sort a data frame by a variable and subset to the rows associated with the highest values of that variable
dplyr,summarize,Calculate one or more summary statistics on a variable or variables in a data frame (often used in conjunction with `group_by()` but may also be used with `.by = ...`)
magrittr,%>%,The pipe operator passes the output of the LHS argument to the function on the right
readr,read_rds,Read an RDS file into R
tidyr,replace_na,Replace an NA value in a vector with a different value
