Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,~,The formula operator separates the left- and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) in a formula.
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
.Primitive,::,Infix operator that can be used to access a package environment without attaching the whole package environment to your current session
.Primitive,[…],Extraction operator used to index multiple values from a data object (LHS) based on the position or values specified inside the brackets
.Primitive,[[…]],Extraction operator used to index a single value from a data object (LHS) based on the position or values specified inside the brackets
