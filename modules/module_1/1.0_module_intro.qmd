Welcome to **Managing Ecological Data in R: Introduction to Data Science and the Art of Wrangling for Ecologists**! In this course, we will explore the management of ecological data using Program R. You will gain an in-depth understanding of how to apply the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/){target="_blank"} to efficiently wrangle ecological data. We will focus on the structure and linguistics of data in R, how to integrate R into a modern data science workflow, and explore how to think about ecological data in new ways.

## Module overview

In this first module, we will cover the basic concepts and primary tools that we will use in this course. We will not be working with much real data yet (but soon will!). Instead, this first module is really dedicated to developing a conceptual understanding of R that we can build on throughout the course. This module is divided into six sections:

-   **1.1. Course introduction**: A general introduction to the content of this course, where to find course resources, and how to navigate course content.
-   **1.2. Getting started**: This section provides the [*necessary*]{style="color:red;"} steps that you must take *prior* to completing the content of this module.
-   **1.3. Objects**: This lesson is an enhanced review of functions, environments, and common data objects. Special emphasis is placed on developing a vocabulary that will give you the flexibility to address, and understand, more complex operations.
-   **1.4. Importing, exploring, and exporting data**: Here, we will review how to import and export [.csv]{.mono} and [.rds]{.mono} files, you will learn how to read in [.xlsx]{.mono} files, and I will describe exploratory steps that should be taken *every time* you read in a file.
-   **1.5. Assignments**: In this lesson, we will review global (and "local") assignments, you will learn the benefits and pitfalls of global assignments. Along the way, you will learn how to use base R's pipe operator and I will provide recommendations to improve your R workflow and manage your global environment.
-   **1.6. Course style guide, part 1**: Modern standards in R coding compel us to generate code that is consistent, parsimonious, and communicable. This tutorial provides an introduction to code formatting rules that I will ask you to follow in the course.
-   **1.7. Solving problem sets**: My problem sets are notoriously pretty tough, but this quick guide will help you solve them with much less hair-pulling!

*Note: We will quickly build on the content herein, so please be sure to read/view all content in the order that it appears!*

## About this week's data

This week we will use the following data files in our exercises (*Note: You will download this content in **Lesson 1.2 Getting Started***):

**Global populations and CO2 emissions** ([API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_2764620.csv]{.mono}): These data were compiled by the [World Bank DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx) and provides information on the emissions of greenhouse gases and the populations of countries around the world. Neither the tabular data nor the name of the file were modified from the original version.

**Iris** ([iris.csv]{.mono} and [iris.rds]{.mono}): This is Edgar Anderson’s famous data set that provides the measurements of flowers of three species of iris, Iris setosa, I. versicolor, and I. virginica. See `?iris` for more information (or the original paper at [this link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2394164)!).

**My Covid garden** ([my_covid_garden.xlsx]{.mono}, [my_covid_garden.csv]{.mono}, [my_covid_garden.rds]{.mono}, and [badNameDataFrame.csv]{.mono}): These are tabular data sets (in different formats) that describes a pretty unsuccessful raised bed garden at my home in Takoma Park, Maryland.

**Portal rodents** ([portal.csv]{.mono} and [portal.xlsx]{.mono}). These data sets provide measurements taken in a long term study (the Portal project) on rodent traits in Portal, Arizona. The provided data were collected in a fixed grid established in 1977 and include when an individual was measured, where the measurement occurred, the sex and species of the individual, and their hindfoot length. You can read more about this study and the data they collected at this [link](https://portal.weecology.org/){target="_blank"}. I intentionally made the data a good bit messier than the original version.

::: panel
-   **Assignment (noun)**: A reference that R uses to call data from your computer’s memory (also called "name").
-   **Assignment (verb)**: The act of associating a name with an object (typically to the global environment).
-   **Atomic vector**: A one-dimensional homogenous data object.
-   **Child**: An object whose name is stored as a reference in a parent object.
-   **Class**: A blueprint that describes an object's structure.
-   **Code section**: A portion of an R script file that is delineated by a section header.
-   **Core tidyverse package** or **Core tidyverse**: Packages that are attached with `library(tidyverse)`.
-   **csv file**: A file stored in the "comma separated values" format. This describes a plain text file where commas separate values and each record (e.g., row in a data frame) is placed on a new line.
-   **Data frame**: A two-dimensional, and potentially heterogeneous data object (that is a restrictive type of list under-the-hood).
-   **Data object**: Containers for values that structure references in an ordered, predictable way.
-   **Double numeric vector**: An atomic numeric vector where the values are stored as decimal numbers (essentially).
-   **Environment**: A dimensionless container that contains references (names) to data stored in memory.
-   **Environment** (of a function): The location of a function's variables.
-   **Experimental** (function): A function currently being tested for permanent distribution in a package (these functions are usually, but not always, safe to use).
-   **Formals**: Arguments within a function.
-   **Function**: A set of instructions used to complete a given task.
-   **Infix function**: A function in which the name of the function is placed between the function's arguments.
-   **Install (a package)**: Download the data and functions from a package onto your computer.
-   **Integer**: A whole number, or an atomic vector of data stored as whole numbers.
-   **List**: A one dimensional, and potentially heterogeneous, data object.
-   **List item**: A data object contained within a list.
-   **Matrix**: A two-dimensional homogeneous data object (that is an atomic vector under-the-hood).
-   **Memory (RAM)**: A temporary storage location for instructions (functions) and data.
-   **Metadata**: Descriptive information that provides crucial summary details about a data object.
-   **Name**: A reference that R uses to call data from your computer’s memory (also called "assignment").
-   **Observation**: A row within a data frame.
-   **Order**: The position of values (or child objects) within a data object.
-   **Package environment**: A collection of variable names associated with objects in a package.
-   **Parent**: An object or environment that contains references to other objects.
-   **Primitive function**: A function written in C code and made available to use through the base R package.
-   **Project**: A collection of files that is referenced by a `.RProj` file.
-   **RDS file**: A storage format for data sets that are written in, and written for, program R.
-   **Recursive object**: Objects that are made up of references to other objects (e.g., a list).
-   **Relative file path**: The path to a file on your hard drive relative to the current working directory.
-   **Session**: The time spent and operations conducted since opening R.
-   **Superseded** (function): A function for which a new function or argument has been added to a package (these functions should typically be avoided).
-   **Tab**: Each pane has a tab on the top of it. For example, I will often refer to the Environment or History tabs of the workspace pane.
-   **Tibble**: A type of data frame with great benefits!
-   **Type**: How an object is stored in your computer.
-   **Variable**: A column in a data frame.
-   **Version history**: Changes to a package since its inception.

<button class="accordion">Functions used through the end of this module (I am a button ... click me!)</button>
::: panel
**Important!** Primitive functions as well as functions in the *base* and *utils* packages, are loaded by default when you start an R session. Functions in *tibble* and *tidyverse* are loaded with `library(tidyverse)`. Although the *magrittr* package is not a part of the core tidyverse, the `%>%` function is imported by the *dplyr* (core tidyverse) library.

::: function_table

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
