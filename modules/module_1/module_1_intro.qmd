Welcome to **Managing Ecological Data in R: Introduction to Data Science and the Art of Wrangling for Ecologists**! In this course, we will explore the management of ecological data using Program R. You will gain an in-depth understanding of how to apply the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/){target="_blank"} to efficiently wrangle ecological data. We will focus on the structure and linguistics of data in R, how to integrate R into a modern data science workflow, and explore how to think about ecological data in new ways.

## Module overview

In this first module, we will cover the basic concepts and primary tools that we will use in this course. We will not be working with much real data yet (but soon will!). Instead, this first module is really dedicated to developing a conceptual understanding of R that we can build on throughout the course. This module is divided into five sections:

-   **1.1. Course introduction**: A general introduction to the content of this course, where to find course resources, and how to navigate course content.
-   **1.2. Getting started**: This section provides the [*necessary*]{style="color:red;"} steps that you must take *prior* to completing the content of this module.
-   **1.3. Objects**: This lesson is an enhanced review of functions, environments, and common data objects. Special emphasis is placed on developing a vocabulary that will give you the flexibility to address, and understand, more complex operations.
-   **1.4. Importing, exploring, and exporting data**: Here, we will review how to import and export in [.csv]{.mono} and [.rds]{.mono} files, you will learn how to read in [.xlsx]{.mono} files, and I will describe exploratory steps that should be taken *every time* you read in a file.
-   **1.5. Assignments**: In this lesson, we will review global (and "local") assignments, you'll learn the benefits and pitfalls of global assignments. Along the way, you learn how to use base R's pipe operator and I will provide recommendations to improve your R workflow and manage your global environment.

*Note: We will quickly build on the content herein, so please be sure to read/view all content in the order that it appears!*
