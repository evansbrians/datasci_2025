GitHub provides an efficient, well-organized, workflow for collaborating with code. If you are not careful, however, it can sometimes also lead to disastrous, time-consuming, problems that can hinder collaborations. When using version control on my own, I typically follow the methodology that I demonstrated in ***Lesson 7.2. Solo Github***. When collaborating with others, I employ additional methods. In the video lesson below (runtime: 16:41), I cover two methods that you can use to avoid such problems occurring. You will learn:

* The dangers (and annoyance) of the "solo GitHub workflow"
* Collaborating with GitHub via branching repositories
* Collaborating with GitHub via forking repositories
