Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,{…},Operator that passes the last operation in `{...}` to the global environment
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,~,The formula operator separates the left- and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) in a formula.
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
