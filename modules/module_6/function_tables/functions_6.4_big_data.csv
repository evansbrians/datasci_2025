Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,{…},Operator that passes the last operation in `{...}` to the global environment
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,~,The formula operator separates the left- and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) in a formula.

dplyr,slice_max,Sort a data frame by a variable and subset to the rows associated with the highest values of that variable
dplyr,summarize,Calculate one or more summary statistics on a variable or variables in a data frame (often used in conjunction with `group_by()` but may also be used with `.by = ...`)
