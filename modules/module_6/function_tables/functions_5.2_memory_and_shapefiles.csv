Package,Function,Definition
.Primitive,(...),Operator that evaluates the function name on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the opening parentheses using the arguments enclosed by the parentheses
.Primitive,<-,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,=,Infix operator that assigns an object on the right-hand-side (RHS) to a name on the left-hand-side (LHS) -- this should not be used for global assignments!
.Primitive,~,The formula operator separates the left- and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) in a formula.
.Primitive,:,Infix operator that generates a regular sequence of adjacent values
.Primitive,::,Infix operator that can be used to access a package environment without attaching the whole package environment to your current session

.Primitive,names,Retrieve the names (or names attribute) assigned to an R object (generates a character vector)
.Primitive,sum,Calculate the sum of the values in a vector
base,%in%,Infix relational operator that tests whether the vector on the left-hand-side (LHS) is within the vector on the right
base,file.path,Create a file path by concatenating strings
base,library,Attach the package environment for a given package to the current R session
base,ls,Generate a character vector of names in a specified environment (default is the global environment)
base,nrow,"Return the number of rows (i.e., observations) in a data frame as a one-value integer vector"
base,rm,Remove a name from a specified environment (default is the global environment)
base,source,Execute a source script (in its entirety)
bench,mark,Benchmark an operation (processing time and memory used)
dplyr,bind_rows,Combine rows of two or more tibbles to create a new tibble
dplyr,distinct,Subset a data frame by removing duplicate rows
dplyr,filter,Subset a data frame by logical condition
dplyr,group_by,Group the data in a data frame by a given variable such that one or more subsequent analyses are run separately on each group
dplyr,mutate,Add or modify a column in a data frame
dplyr,pull,Extract a column from a data frame as a vector
dplyr,select,Subset columns in a data frame by name (without quotes!)
dplyr,summarize,Calculate one or more summary statistics on a variable or variables in a data frame (often used in conjunction with `group_by()` but may also be used with `.by = ...`)

ggplot2,facet_wrap,Split plot into facets
ggplot2,geom_sf,Add an sf layer to a ggplot
ggplot2,ggplot,"Set the data and, potentially, the aesthetics of a plot"
ggplot2,theme_set,Set the ggplot theme for an entire session
ggplot2,theme_void,A ggplot theme that contains no axes or panel background
lobstr,obj_size,View the amount of memory allocated to an object in your computer's memory
magrittr,%>%,The pipe operator passes the output of the LHS argument to the function on the right
mapview,npts,"Determine the number of vertices (i.e., nodes or points) in a polygon"
purrr,map,Iterate across a vector and return a list
rlang,set_names,Assign names to values in a vector or items in a list

sf,st_drop_geometry,Remove the geometry column from an sf file and (thus) convert to a data frame
sf,st_geometry_type,Return the type of geometry present in an sf object
sf,st_intersection,A type of mutating *or* filtering spatial join in which you maintain only portions of a target shapefile that overlap with a source shapefile
sf,st_join,Conduct a mutating join of a target table relative to the geometry of a source table
sf,st_read,Read in a simple features or other GIS shapefile
sf,st_simplify,Increase the resolution of a shapefile by removing nodes that are within a given distance
