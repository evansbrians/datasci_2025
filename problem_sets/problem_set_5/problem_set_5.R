# Script file for problem set 5: District cats

# 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Before opening your script file for this problem set, change the name of
# `problem_set_4.R` to "problem_set_4_[last name]_[first name].R" using a snake
# case naming convention. *Note: You will submit this script file as your
# assignment*.

# 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Open the script file in RStudio and attach the core tidyverse packages to your
# current R session.



# 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Read in `district_cats.rds` and globally assign the list object to the name
# `dc_cats`.



# 4 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The table represented by the list item `visits` is unfortunately not tidy.
# Normalize this list item:

# * Extract `visits` from `dc_cats.`
# * Combine the columns `year`, `month`, and `day` into a single ISO 8601
#   formatted date class column.
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `visits_tidy`.



# 5 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The data frame represented by the list item named sites has a primary key
# and a few columns of interest that should be numeric but are currently
# character vectors.

# * Extract sites from `dc_cats`;
# * As parsimoniously as possible, convert `percent_impervious` and 
#   `population_density` to numeric;
# * Maintain only the primary key and the two columns that you converted 
#   to numeric;
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `site_characteristics`.



# 6 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The list item `detections` in the list `district_cats` contains misspellings,
# inconsistencies in the species column, and more information than we are
# currently interested in.

# * As parsimoniously as possible, and without using `if_else()` or 
#   `case_when()`, repair the spelling within the `species` variable such 
#   that the values are provided as "cat", "dog" and "squirrel";
# * Generate a summary table where the variable `count` displays the total
#   count of animals observed per `species` and `visit_id`;
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `observations`.



# 7 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# | Impervious surface | Classified land-use intensity |
# |    0 - 15%         |   Rural                       |  
# |    > 15 - 25%      |   Low-intensity suburb        |
# |    > 25 - 40%      |   High-intensity suburb       |
# |    > 40%           |   Urban                       |

# Classify `percent_impervious` in the data frame `site_characteristics` as
# described in the table above. In doing so:

# * Assign the name `urban_intensity` to the derived column;
# * Maintain only the fields `site_id` and `urban_intensity`;
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `land_use`.



# 8 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using `observations` and `visits_tidy` (or their lifelines):

# * Create a column that contains the value 1 for visits where at least  
#   one cat was detected and the value 0 for visits where no cats were 
#   detected;
# * Assign the name `presence_absence` to the derived variable;
# * Maintain only the variables `visit_id`, `site_id`, and `presence_absence`  
#   in the resultant object;
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `cat_occurrence`.



# 9 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's visualize the proportion of visits with cat detections for each urban
# intensity class. Using `cat_occurrence` and `land_use` (or their lifelines), 
# generate a bar plot where:

# * The x-axis represents the classified urban intensity
# * The y-axis is the proportion of visits in which a cat was observed (number
#   of visits where cats were present / total number of visits);
# * The levels of `urban_intensity` are arranged in the order "Rural",
#   "Low-intensity suburb", "High-intensity suburb" and "Urban.
# * The x-axis is titled "Urban intensity", the y-axis is titled "Proportion of
#   visits with cats present", and the plot is titled "Proportion of cat
#   detections across urban intensity classes".
# * The y-axis ranges from 0 to 0.8.
# * Use three or more arguments of `theme()` to modify the theme elements of
#   the plot however you like!
