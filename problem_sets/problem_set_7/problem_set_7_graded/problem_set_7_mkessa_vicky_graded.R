# A common problem in data management is column values that have been
# reversed. In `backwards columns`, column "a" is intended to contain only
# negative numbers and column "b" is intended to contain only positive numbers.
# If column `a` is positive, replace that value with the negative value in
# column `b`. If column `b` is negative, replace that value with the positive 
# value in column `a`.

# The dataset `leps_dc` contains all of the observations of Lepidoptera in

#   if not, which tidy data rule the tibble violates:

# The data Violates the 3rd tidy data rule that all columns are non-transitively 
# dependent. The two columns scientific_name and common_name all describe the lepidoptera species observed in 2021, so dataset should have kept one column.

# * Subset the data to observations of the three species with the most total
#   number of observations across time and assign the name common_leps to the 
#   resultant object:
