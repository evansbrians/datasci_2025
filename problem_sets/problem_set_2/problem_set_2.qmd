My problem sets have a reputation for being pretty difficult. Here, I intend to train you on how to complete them with as little pain as possible (and with minimal points taken off). "Training" tips and tricks will be shared in a [yellow box]{style="border: 1px solid #999999; background-color: #FFF8DC; padding: 2px;"} with a spy icon (<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-1x"></i>). Portions of this problem set in which user input is required are highlighted in a [&nbsp;blue box with a dark blue border on the left]{style="border-left: 8px solid #292093; background-color: #e6ffff; padding: 2px;"}.

### Grading

The points allotted for each question are provided in highlighted red bold text (e.g., <span class = "score">[1.0]</span>) within the question itself. When applicable, total points for a question may represent the sum of individually graded components, which are provided in red text (e.g., <span class = "subscore">[1.0]</span>).

Points may be deducted from each question's total: 

* [[50% per violation]]{class="subscore"} Use only functions listed in "Functions that you may use in this assignment";
* [[50%]]{class="subscore"} Include only assignments specified in the question;
* [[10%]]{class="subscore"} Ensure that all code is properly indented;
* [[10%]]{class="subscore"} Ensure that the class of your response is consistent with the wording of the question (e.g., if you are asked to return a "value" or "vector", ensure that the resultant object is not a data frame).

*Note: The maximum deduction is the total points value for a given question*


:::{class="mysecret"}
<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-2x"></i> Click the blue button below to view the functions that you may use in completing this problem set. Make sure that you know what each function does (use `?[function name]` if you do not). Do not use any functions outside of this list!

**Important!** Primitive functions and functions in the *base* package are loaded by default when you start an R session. Functions in *dplyr*, *ggplot2*, *readr*, and *tidyr* are loaded with `library(tidyverse)`. Although the *magrittr* package is not a part of the core tidyverse, the `%>%` function is imported by the *dplyr* (core tidyverse) library.

In answering the questions for this assignment, you may **only** use the following R functions in your submitted R script (but you may use additional functions to explore the data):

* `.Primitive, ()`
* `.Primitive, =`
* `.Primitive, :`
* `.Primitive, ==`
* `.Primitive, >=`
* `.Primitive, <=`
* `.Primitive, /`
* `.Primitive, c`
* `base::%in%`
* `base::library`
* `base::list2env`
* `base::mean`
* `dplyr::filter`
* `dplyr::mutate`
* `dplyr::n`
* `dplyr::pull`
* `dplyr::rename`
* `dplyr::select`
* `dplyr::summarize`
* `ggplot2::+`

## About the data 

This problem set will use `district_birds.rds`, a tidy dataset that contains a subset of records from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center's <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/neighborhood-nestwatch">Neighborhood Nestwatch</a> (NN) program. NN is a community science project where scientists visits backyards, neighborhoods, and schools to conduct bird banding demonstrations and sample bird populations. The data include tables for sites, visits, point counts, and capture events, and a table that provides natural history information for observed birds. Geographic coordinate values have been jittered to protect the privacy of NN participants. 

::: Accordion
<button class="accordion">Click this button to learn more!</button>

::: {.panel}

In this lesson, we will only be working with the `capture` dataset. These data describe information collected when a wild bird has been captured and released. Variables in this table include:

* `capture_id` (character): The primary key of the table;
* `visit_id` (character): A foreign key to the `visits` table;
* `band_number` (character): A unique numeric identifier for an aluminum band placed on a bird;
* `color_combo` (character): A combination of color bands that are added to some birds for quick identification of individuals;
* `spp` (character): A four-letter code for the species banded (see the `birds` table)
* `sex` (character): The sex of the bird (F = female, M = male, U = unknown);
* `age` (character): A code for the age class of the bird (e.g., HY = "Hatch year", AHY = "After hatch year");
* `wing` (numeric, double): The length of a bird's wing, in millimeters;
* `tl` (numeric, double): The length of a bird's tail, in millimeters;
* `mass` (numeric, double): The mass of the bird, in grams;
* `bp_cp` (character): A code for the breeding condition of a bird (bp = "brood patch", cp = "cloacal protuberance");
* `fat` (character): An ordinal code for how much fat the bird is carrying.

## Getting started (gimme questions)

:::{class="mysecret"}
<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-2x"></i>  Remember that it is best practice to start with a clean R Studio session (i.e., close any script files, remove objects from your global environment, and clear your history).
:::

I always start my assignments off with some easy points for naming your file, providing your name and the date, and loading any necessary libraries.

:::{class="now_you"}
1\. [[1.0]]{class="score"} Before opening your script file for this problem set, change the name of
the `problem_set_2.R` to "problem_set_2_[last name]_[first name].R" using a snake case naming convention. *Note: You will submit this script file as your assignment*.

:::{class="mysecret"}
<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-2x"></i> Be very careful with the naming convention of your file and follow the instructions to-the-letter!
:::

2\. [[0.50]]{class="score"} Open the script file in RStudio and attach the tidyverse metapackage to
your current R session.

:::

## Straightforward questions

After you have completed the first round of gimme questions, the next set of questions that you will address are pretty straightforward -- they are *nearly* identical to coding steps that you have taken when completing the videos or tutorials. These will make up the bulk of the questions in most problem sets.

For example ...

:::{class="now_you"}
3\. [[0.50]]{class="score"}The data file `district_birds.rds` is structured as a list object. The following code:

* Reads in the list object
* Globally assigns the list object to the name `my_list`
* Globally assigns each list item to a name
* Ensures that the name `my_list` is not stored in the global environment

```{r q4_read_assign, eval = FALSE}
my_list <-
  read_rds("data/raw/district_birds.rds")

sites <- my_list$sites

visits <- my_list$visits

counts <- my_list$counts

captures <- my_list$captures

birds <- my_list$birds

rm(my_list)
```

As parsimoniously as possible, modify the above by reading in the data and assigning the names of each of the individual list items to the global environment in a single code block (*Note: `my_list` should not be added to the global environment*).

:::

You can typically recognize a straightforward question, because they will almost directly reflect a process that you completed in one of the lessons!

:::{class="mysecret"}
<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-2x"></i> It pays to keep track of when a function was first used (or used elsewhere in new ways). The answer to the above question was covered in the tutorial "Reshaping data frames" and in the video lesson "Tidy data".
:::

:::{class="now_you"}
4\. [[1.0]]{class="score"} The code block below uses a nested coding structure to calculate the average mass of American robins ("AMRO"):
 
```{r q5_nested_to_pipe, eval = FALSE}
mean(
  captures[captures$spp == "AMRO", ]$mass,
  na.rm = TRUE)
```

*Note: `na.rm = TRUE` is an argument of `mean()` that removes `NA` values from the calculation.*

Please replace the above with a code block in which each step in the process is connected by a pipe and only "Functions that you may use in this assignment" are used (of course, this is required for each question in this problem set!).
:::

The "straightforward questions" typically ask you to dig into the material that you have been provided. The goal of these questions is largely for you to be able to self-assess your understanding of the material that we perceive to be especially important. For example, I’m really a fan of adhering to “best practices in R coding” …

:::{class="now_you"}
5\. [[2.0]]{class="score"} The code block below generates a box plot to visualize the distribution of bird mass by species. The code works as expected, but is inconsistent and sloppy. Without removing comments or changing the output, modify the code block such that it follows the conventions our course style guide.

```{r q6_best_practices, eval = FALSE}
captures %>% 
  filter(spp%in% c("CACH", "CARW", "GRCA", "NOCA", "SOSP")) %>%
  drop_na(mass) %>% 
  # Initiate plot:
  ggplot() +
  
  # Define aesthetics and geometry:
  
  aes(x=spp, y = mass) + geom_boxplot(fill = "#88ccee") +
  
  # Define scale:
  
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0,75), 
    expand = c(0, 0))+
  
  # Flip axes:
  
  coord_flip() +
  
  # Define theme:
  
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(color = "black"), 
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "#dcdcdc"))
```
:::

"Straightforward questions" may, however, ask you to conduct operations that are similar to those that you have done before but in new ways! For example ...

:::{class="now_you"}
6\. [[1.0]]{class="score"} The code block below uses some pretty dated coding methods to:

* Subset the data to Carolina chickadees
* Convert the wing length from millimeters to inches (1 inch = 25.4 mm)
* Filter the data frame to wing lengths that are greater than or equal to
  2.3 inches and less than or equal to 2.5 inches
* Subset the variables to `capture_id`, `sex`, `age`, and `wing`
* Ensure that the name `cach` is not stored in the global environment

```{r q6}
# Subset data to Carolina chickadees:

cach <-
  captures[captures$spp == "CACH", ]

# Extract the mass variable from the data:

cach$wing <- cach$wing/25.4

# Subset the data:

cach[
  cach$wing >= 2.3 & 
    cach$wing <= 2.5 & 
    !is.na(cach$wing),
  c("capture_id",
    "sex",
    "age",
    "wing")]

rm(cach)
```

Using `captures` as your starting point, please complete all of the steps in the operation above in a single code block.
:::

## Integrated questions

While the goals of the "straightforward questions" are to get you to read the material carefully and examine your ability to understand the material as it was presented, the goal of the integrated questions goes a bit further. Here, we seek to assess whether you are able to *integrate* content that you have learned across multiple lessons.

For example, the following draws on content from ***Preliminary lesson 1.4*** and lesson ***2.1. Reshaping data frames***. 

:::{class="now_you"}
7\. [[1.5]]{class="score"} The code block below attempts to provide a summary data frame that describes the number of captures and average mass of three bird species (Gray catbird: "GRCA", Northern Cardinal: "NOCA", Song sparrow: "SOSP"). Unfortunately, there are four operational errors (i.e., not styling errors) in the code. Without adding any additional functions, please fix the errors in the code!

```{r q7_fixing_problems, eval = FALSE}
captures %>% 
  filter(spp == c("GRCA" , "NOCA", "SOSP")) %>% 
  summarize(
    captures,
    n_birds = n(),
    mass = mean(mass)
  )
```
:::

More typically, integrated questions are meant to mirror real-world scenarios that we often experience when working with data in R. The wording of such questions may be a bit vague (or at least less paint-by-numbers). For example ...

:::{class="now_you"}

8\. [[2.5]]{class="score"} Without assigning any names to the global environment, generate a box plot (`geom_boxplot()`) that describes the distribution of mass *and* tail measurements of American robins (spp: "AMRO"). For full credit:

* [[0.25]]{class="subscore"} Remove the gray plot background 
* [[0.25]]{class="subscore"} Add gray axis lines
* [[0.25]]{class="subscore"} Ensure that there are no warning messages when plotting the data
* [[0.25]]{class="subscore"} Label the measured variables `Mass` and `Tail`

:::{class="mysecret"}
<i class="fas fa-user-secret fa-2x"></i> To address this question, I suggest the following work flow (in brief):

1. First try to visualize how the answer will look. 
2. After considering what the answer will look like, I write out or draw a schema (on a whiteboard or with pencil and paper) that outlines the steps needed to achieve that result. For example, how must your data be structured such that the both `wing` and `mass` are treated as a single variable?
3. Append your schema with the functions that can be used for each step.
4. Convert your appended schema to code.
5. Test to see that it worked!
