# Answer key for problem set 3: Counting caterpillars

# question 1 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Before opening your script file for this problem set, change the name of
# the `problem_set_3.R` to "problem_set_3_[last name]_[first name].R" using
# a snake case naming convention. *Note: You will submit this script file 
# as your assignment*.

# question 2 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Open the script file in RStudio and attach the tidyverse metapackage to 
# your current R session.



# question 3 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Read in the `caterpillars_count.rds` and assign the names of the list to the
# global environment.



# question 4 --------------------------------------------------------------

# How many caterpillars has Caterpillars Count counted? Please provide your
# answer as a one-value numeric vector.



# question 5 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Subset the `sites` data frame to where `region` is `DC` (District of
# Columbia), `MD` (Maryland), or `VA` (Virginia and globally assign the name
# `sites_dmv` to the resultant object.



# question 6 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a summary table that displays the number of surveys by year across
# regions and arrange from highest to lowest number of surveys.



# question 7 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Subset the survey_locations data frame to those that are located within sites
# in the District of Columbia, Maryland, or Virginia. For full credit, please
# complete this such that:

# * No columns are added to, or removed from, `survey_locqtions`;
# * The `filter` function is not used to subset rows;
# * The `select` function is not used to subset columns.



# question 8 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Please generate a summary table that provides the average (mean) number of
# caterpillars observed in "Beat sheet" and "Visual" surveys across sampling
# regions. Note that to properly address this question you will have to do
# something about surveys in which no caterpillars were observed!



# question 9 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Please generate a bar plot that displays the total number of surveys conducted
# in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia in 2024.



# question 10 --------------------------------------------------------------

# Please generate a summary table that provides the total number of arthropods
# counted per state in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia in 2024.
