# Script file for the final exam

# You may include a maximum of one global assignment per code block. If you
# choose to do so, please remove all previously assigned objects at the end of
# each question.

# For each question that includes a ggplot, you will receive up to 1 point
# extra credit for the styling of your visualizations (e.g., theme elements,
# fill color).

# 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Open the script file in RStudio and attach the core tidyverse packages to your
# current R session.



# 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Read in `data/raw/va_wildlife_collisions.rds` and globally assign the
# resultant object to the name `collisions`:



# 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fix all variables that include date and/or time values:

# * Ensure that all times in the data frame are formatted as ISO-8601 datetime
#   values and stored as datetime objects. *Note: This includes the columns
#   `crash_time`, `county_sunrise`, and `county_sunset`*.
# * Remove any transitive columns.
# * Arrange the resultant table from earliest to most recent collisions. 
# * Globally assign the name `collisions_date_fix` to the resultant object.



# Remove the name `collisions` from your global environment:



# 4 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Repair the `species` column:

# * Ensure that the four species are recorded as (with the first letter
#   capitalized) "Black bear", "Opossum", "Raccoon", and "White-tailed deer".
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `collisions_spp_fix`.



# Remove the name collisions_date_fix from your global environment:



# 5 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Some of the geographic coordinates (longitudes and latitudes) were switched in
# the records! Please:

# * Modify the data such that these coordinates are provided in the correct
#   columns.
# * Globally assign the resultant object to the name `collisions_coord_fix`.



# Remove the name `collisions_spp_fix` from your global environment:



# 6 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Organize the data into a relational database:

# * Make these data database-ready by normalizing (i.e., tidying) the data.
#   Remember to follow all of Hadleyâ€™s principles of tidy data!
# * Store the resultant objects within a single list file globally assigned to
#   the name collisions_tidy.



# Remove the name collisions_coord_fix from your global environment:



# 7 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Generate a summary table of the total number of the total number of collisions
# by species and year, where the columns are `year` and the names of each
# species:



# 8 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a visualization of the total number of collisions by species and year:

# * Complete all data processing steps (correctly) prior to piping the data 
#   into `ggplot()`.
# * Create a scatterplot with the total annual collisions on the vertical axis
#   and year on the horizontal axis.
# * Use `geom_line()` to connect the points in the scatterplot.
# * Create a facet for each species.
# * Make sure that the y-axis is scaled so we can see annual variation in each
#   facet. You can do that by setting scales = "free" (check out ?facet_wrap).



# 9 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prove your iteration skills to Chad:

# * Use iteration to generate four separate bar plots where each plot 
#   represents a single species.
# * Ensure that the horizontal axis of each plot represents years.
# * Ensure that the vertical axis represents the total number of collisions
#   with a given species on a given year.
# * Title each plot with the common name of the species.



# 10 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Check small animal collision reports. In a single code block, please:

# * Verify whether every county reported at least one Opossum or Raccoon
#   collision in 2017.
# * If you find that some of these counties are missing, please provide me 
#   with a character vector of the offending county names.



# 11 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Generate a visualization of the total number of crashes per year for the 10
# counties with the highest number of total crashes across years. Please:

# * Complete all data processing steps (correctly) prior to piping the data
#   into ggplot().
# * Visualize the data with a boxplot geometry.
# * Ensure that the horizontal axis of the plot is the number of crashes in a
#   given year and the vertical axis is the names of the counties.
# * Arrange the plot from the county with the most crashes, across time, to
#   the county with the least amount of crashes across time.

# Note: You may use up to two global assignments to address this task!



# 12 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a visualization of collisions by season (Sept-Nov = Fall; Dec-Feb =
# Winter; Mar-May = Spring; June-Aug = Summer). Please:

# * Complete all data processing steps (correctly) prior to piping the data 
#   into `ggplot()`.
# * Visualize the data with a stacked bar plot geometry.
# * Ensure that the horizontal axis is season, in the order Winter, Spring,
#   Summer, Fall.
# * Ensure that the vertical axis is the total number of collisions, across 
#   years.

# Complete memo 11 in a single piped statement:



# extra credit 3 ----------------------------------------------------------

# Do more accidents occur when a vehicle is traveling into or away from the
# sun?

# * Subset to only vehicles traveling East or West.
# * Subset the data to collisions that occurred within two hours of the sunrise
#   time (Note: You may round the time to hour to address this question).
# * Classify the incidents that occurred for Eastbound drivers as "Into the 
#   sun" and those that occurred for Westbound drivers as "Away from the sun".
# * Generate a data visualization (of your choosing!) that illustrates whether
#   more incidents occur for vehicles traveling into, or away from, the sun.
