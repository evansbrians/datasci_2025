# extra credit for the styling of your visualizations (e.g., theme elements,
# fill color).

# Do more accidents occur when a vehicle is traveling into or away from the
# sun?

# * Subset to only vehicles traveling East or West.
# * Subset the data to collisions that occurred within two hours after the 
#   sunrise time (Note: You may round the time to hour to address this 
#   question).
# * Classify the incidents that occurred for Eastbound drivers as "Into the 
#   sun" and those that occurred for Westbound drivers as "Away from the sun".
# * Generate a data visualization (of your choosing!) that illustrates whether
#   more incidents occur for vehicles traveling into, or away from, the sun.
